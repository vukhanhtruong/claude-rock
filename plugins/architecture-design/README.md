# Architecture Design - Claude Skill

A comprehensive Claude skill for creating professional software architecture documentation through guided interviews and template-based generation.

## Overview

The Architecture Design skill transforms Claude into an expert architecture consultant capable of generating detailed, standardized ARCHITECTURE.md files. It helps development teams create comprehensive documentation that accelerates onboarding and improves system understanding.

[Sample architecture document](https://hackmd.io/@B0gg3-MvQL-KX7jvQ4KI8Q/rkErFMUCgl) for a Trello clone app with NextJS and Supbabase generated by this skill.

## How to Use

### Trigger the Skill

Say any of these:

- "Create architecture documentation"
- "Document my system architecture"
- "Design a new architecture"

### Usage Examples

```
"Create architecture documentation for my Node.js e-commerce platform"
```

```
"Design an architecture for an e-commerce application using Java Spring Boot microservices"
```

```
"Create a full architecture documentation package for my serverless application on AWS"
```

```
"Generate architecture for my Python Django application"
```

#### Need to update? Just say:

`"Update the architecture documentation"`

`"Add Redis cache to the architecture"`

`"Document the new services"`

### Answer Questions

The skill will ask 5-7 questions about:

- Architecture pattern (monolith/microservices/serverless)
- Technology stack (Node.js/Python/Java/etc.)
- Components and services
- Data stores
- Deployment infrastructure

## Speed & Efficiency

- **Questions**: 5-7 focused questions
- **Time**: 2-3 minutes to complete
- **Output**: Comprehensive 11-section document
- **Quality**: Professional, validated, complete

## Pro Tips

### For New Projects

- Be clear about your architecture goals
- Mention any constraints upfront
- Specify your tech preferences

### For Existing Systems

- Describe current pain points
- Mention planned improvements
- Identify undocumented areas

### For Best Results

- Answer questions completely
- Provide specific names (not generic terms)
- Mention actual tools and services you use
- Let the skill know your deployment target

## Key Benefits

1. **Consistency**: Standard format every time
2. **Completeness**: No missing sections
3. **Specificity**: Your tech stack, your patterns
4. **Speed**: Minutes instead of hours
5. **Quality**: Industry best practices included
6. **Validation**: Automatic checks for completeness

## Troubleshooting

### Skill Not Working

1. Verify the skill is enabled in Settings > Capabilities
2. Try refreshing Claude and starting a new conversation
3. Check that you're using the correct trigger phrases

### PDF Generation Issues

- PDF generation requires optional tools (pandoc or WeasyPrint)
- If tools aren't available, you'll get clear instructions to install them
- The skill still works without PDF generation

### Diagram Rendering

- Mermaid diagrams can be rendered to PNG with `@mermaid-js/mermaid-cli`
- If not available, you'll get the .mmd source files instead
- These can be rendered later using online [Mermaid editors](https://mermaid.live)
