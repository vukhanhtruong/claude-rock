# Generate 5 Essential Architecture Diagrams in Mermaid.js

## Including C4 Level 1, 2, 3, Data Flow, and C4 Deployment

---

Goal: generate **5 essential architecture diagrams** in Mermaid.js format based on the provided system information.

---

## Instructions

Generate exactly **5 diagrams** in the following order. Each diagram should be complete, syntactically valid Mermaid code ready to render.

### Diagram 1: System Context Diagram (C4 Level 1)

**Purpose**: Show the big picture - your system in context with external users, systems, and services it connects to.

**Output Format**: Use C4Context Mermaid syntax

**Requirements**:

- Show the primary software system as the central element
- Include all external users/actors who interact with the system
- Include all external systems/services the system depends on
- Label all relationships with interaction descriptions
- Use clear, descriptive titles and descriptions

**Mermaid Syntax Template**:

```
C4Context
    title System Context - [System Name]
    Person(customer, "Customer", "End user of the system")
    System(system, "[System Name]", "Core business functionality")
    System_Ext(external, "External System", "Third-party integration")
    Rel(customer, system, "uses")
    Rel(system, external, "calls API")
```

**Key Elements to Include**:

- At least 1-2 external users
- The primary system (your product)
- 2-3 external systems/services it depends on

---

### Diagram 2: Container Diagram (C4 Level 2)

**Purpose**: Zoom into the primary system and show its main building blocks (containers) like web apps, APIs, databases, message queues, etc.

**Output Format**: Use C4Container Mermaid syntax

**Requirements**:

- Break down the system into logical containers (applications, services, databases)
- Show technology choices for each container (e.g., "Node.js API", "PostgreSQL")
- Show interactions between containers with labels
- Keep external systems visible but less detailed
- Include brief descriptions of what each container does

**Mermaid Syntax Template**:

```
C4Container
    title Container Diagram - [System Name]
    Person(user, "User", "System end user")

    System_Boundary(system, "[System Name]") {
        Container(web, "Web Application", "React", "Serves the UI")
        Container(api, "API Server", "Node.js", "Provides API services")
        Container(db, "Database", "PostgreSQL", "Stores application data")
        Container(cache, "Cache", "Redis", "Session and data caching")
    }

    System_Ext(external, "External Service", "Third-party API")

    Rel(user, web, "Uses [HTTPS]")
    Rel(web, api, "Calls [REST API]")
    Rel(api, db, "Reads/Writes [SQL]")
    Rel(api, cache, "Reads/Writes")
    Rel(api, external, "Calls [REST API]")
```

**Key Elements to Include**:

- 3-5 main containers (apps, APIs, databases, services)
- Technology stack for each container
- Container-to-container relationships

---

### Diagram 3: Component Diagram (C4 Level 3)

**Purpose**: Zoom into a specific container and show its internal components/structure (controllers, services, repositories, etc.).

**Output Format**: Use C4Component Mermaid syntax

**Requirements**:

- Focus on ONE important container (usually the API or main service)
- Show internal components/classes/modules within that container
- Show technology/framework for each component
- Show dependencies between components
- Include clear descriptions of each component's responsibility
- Keep it focused - don't show every single component, show the main 5-8

**Mermaid Syntax Template**:

```
C4Component
    title Component Diagram - [Container Name]

    Container_Boundary(container, "[Container Name]") {
        Component(ctrl, "API Controller", "Express Router", "Handles HTTP requests")
        Component(service, "Business Service", "Service Class", "Contains business logic")
        Component(repo, "Data Repository", "Data Access Layer", "Database queries")
        Component(auth, "Auth Component", "JWT/OAuth", "Handles authentication")
        Component(email, "Email Component", "Email Service", "Sends emails")
    }

    ContainerDb(db, "Database", "PostgreSQL", "Persistence")
    System_Ext(email_service, "Email Service", "SendGrid/SMTP")

    Rel(ctrl, service, "Uses")
    Rel(service, repo, "Uses")
    Rel(service, auth, "Uses")
    Rel(service, email, "Uses")
    Rel(repo, db, "Reads/Writes")
    Rel(email, email_service, "Sends via")
```

**Key Elements to Include**:

- 5-8 main internal components
- Component responsibilities clearly described
- Dependencies between components
- External dependencies (databases, services)
- Focus on one container (usually API/backend service)

---

### Diagram 4: Data Flow Diagram (DFD)

**Purpose**: Show how data moves through the system - from sources, through processes and transformations, to storage and destinations.

**Output Format**: Use flowchart syntax with data process symbols

**Requirements**:

- Identify all data sources (users, external systems)
- Show major data processing/transformation steps
- Show all data storage locations (databases, caches, files)
- Show data destinations (output systems, reports, notifications)
- Label flows with data type descriptions
- Use consistent formatting for similar element types

**Mermaid Syntax Template**:

```
flowchart LR
    subgraph sources["üì• Data Sources"]
        user["üë§ User Input"]
        external["üîó External APIs"]
    end

    subgraph processes["‚öôÔ∏è Data Processing"]
        validation["Validate Data"]

        report["Reports"]
        notification["Notifications"]
    end

    user -->|"raw input"| validation
    external -->|"API data"| validation
    validation -->|"valid data"| transform
    transform -->|"structured data"| aggregate
    aggregate -->|"final data"| db
    aggregate -->|"hot data"| cache
    db -->|"queries"| api_out
    cache -->|"session data"| api_out

### Diagram 5: Deployment Diagram (C4Deployment)

**Purpose**: Show how software components are deployed across physical/cloud infrastructure, environments, and how they're replicated/distributed.

**Output Format**: Use C4Deployment Mermaid syntax with Deployment_Node and Node elements

**Requirements**:

- Show deployment environments (production, staging)
- Show cloud providers or infrastructure boundaries
- Show servers/nodes/instances where containers run
- Show load balancers, databases, and other infrastructure
- Show internal connections between nodes
- Indicate scaling and high availability configurations
- Use proper C4Deployment syntax with Deployment_Node, Node, and Rel

**Mermaid Syntax Template**:

```mermaid
C4Deployment
title <Diagram Title>
    Deployment_Node(<id>, "<Name>", "<Technology/Environment>") {
    ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉContainer(<id>, "<Name>", "<Technology>", "<Description>")
    }

    Deployment_Node(<id>, "<Name>", "<Technology/Environment>") {
    ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉDeployment_Node(<id>, "<Name>", "<Technology>") {
    ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉContainer(<id>, "<Name>", "<Technology>", "<Description>")
    ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ}
    }

    Deployment_Node(<id>, "<Name>", "<Technology/Environment>") {
    ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉDeployment_Node(<id>, "<Name>", "<Technology>") {
    ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉContainerDb(<id>, "<Name>", "<Technology>", "<Description>")
    ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ}
    }

    Rel(<source_id>, <target_id>, "<Description>", "<Protocol>")
    Rel_U(<source_id>, <target_id>, "<Description>")
    Rel_R(<source_id>, <target_id>, "<Description>")

    UpdateRelStyle(<source_id>, <target_id>, $offsetX="<value>", $offsetY="<value>")

```

**Notes:**
- Use Deployment_Node for devices, servers, or environments.
- Use Container for applications or services.
- Use ContainerDb for databases.
- Use Rel, Rel_U, or Rel_R for relationships.
- Use UpdateRelStyle to adjust label or arrow positions.

## Generation Steps

1. **Understand the context**: Read and understand the system description
2. **Generate Diagram 1**: System Context (C4 Level 1) - showing external relationships
3. **Generate Diagram 2**: Container (C4 Level 2) - showing internal components and technologies
4. **Generate Diagram 3**: Component (C4 Level 3) - showing one container's internal structure
5. **Generate Diagram 4**: Data Flow - showing how data moves through the system
6. **Generate Diagram 5**: Deployment (C4Deployment) - showing infrastructure and deployment topology

## Output Format

For each diagram, output:

```markdown
### Diagram [Number]: [Diagram Title]

**Description**: [One sentence about what this diagram shows]

**Focus**: [What this diagram emphasizes]

\`\`\`mermaid
